intro:

 Privacy is an individual's right to withhold some of their data which they deem to be private and share the ones they are comfortable with . An algorithm is differentially private if an observer seeing its output cannot tell if a particular individual's information was used in the computation . differential privacy ensures that the probability that a statistical query will produce a given result is (nearly) the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second dataset . that is, the statistical functions run on the database should not overly depend on the data of any one individual . in short, differential privacy permits: . companies access a large number of sensitive data for researching and business without privacy breaches. differential privacy allows the control and analysis of privacy loss acquired by groups .


example:

 Differentially private algorithms make assurance that attackers can learn virtually nothing more about an individual than they would understand if that individualâs record were absent from the dataset . The key challenge is to add enough noise to satisfy the definition of differential privacy, but not so much that the answer becomes too noisy to be useful . In part ii we'll cover some examples of recently developed mechanisms including ones that allow us to perform differentially private machine learning while still building on standard tools . combining such practices with differential privacy with low epsilon values will go a long way in helping to realize the benefits of â�™big data” while reducing the leakage of sensitive personal data . Apple is using differential privacy technology to help discover the usage patterns of a large number of users without compromising individual privacy


history:

 Differential privacy was conceived of only ten years ago, it has been successful in academia and industry . It allows researchers to unearth patterns within a data set and derive observations about the population as a whole while obscuring the information about each individual’s records . In recent years, computer scientists have developed a promising new approach to privacy-preserving data analysis known as âdifferential privacy” . The first blog post will provide background on differential privacy and describe some key concepts that we’ll use in the rest of the series . We’ve helped nist gather differential privacy tools under the topic area of de-identification. sensitivity is a complex topic, and an integral part of designing differentially private algorithms


syntax:

 Dp does not provide any privacy at all for many attributes of the individual . Central model requires constantly searching for new sources of data to maintain high levels of privacy . the more times applying the algorithm on the data, the more privacy loss . choosing a smaller epsilon produces noisier results and better privacy guarantees . Fortunately, this is not the only way to implement a differentially private system. Fortunately,  fortunately this is the other way to . implement a similar system that ensures privacy without the need for a trusted . third party like rappor, suit well the kind of data collection schemes commonly used in the software industry . We will implement the query using both the randomized response mechanism m r (d, 1 2, 1 1, 1
